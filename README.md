## About The Project

This project was created just for fun since I wanted to follow [_Karan's_](https://github.com/karan) projects that are in [_this_](https://github.com/karan/Projects) repository.

Before starting with the projects I realized that I'm too lazy to generate a whole file structure to separate and isolate the projects. So I decided to make a program to do it for me.

This program fetches this URL:
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karan/Projects/master/README.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karan/Projects/master/README.md) and parses it separating subjects from exercises, names and descriptions into a structure and the whole project structure.


### Built With

This program is built purely with [Go](https://golang.org/). No need for extra libraries or any bloated stuff. Minimal and simple.

I've chosen [Go](https://golang.org/) since it's one of the programming languages that I enjoy most.
